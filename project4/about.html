        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello!  My name is AJ Ellis.  I'm currently a student at University of Maryland Global Campus studing Computer Science, with a minor in Web and Digital Design.
        <br>I've been a computer geek my whole life, as well as a car guy.</p>
        <p>My love for game development began as a child, downloading mods in the early 2000's for classic racing games like <i>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</i> and <i>Need for Speed: Most Wanted.</i></p>
        <p>I started making my own mods as a late teenager, and in 2017 I uploaded my first mod – a car model for Need for Speed: Most Wanted, converted from Need for Speed: Shift 2. 
        It used some parts kept from NFS Most Wanted, and included parts from World of Speed, a cancelled racing game developed by the same developers as the Shift series.
        I discovered that their RUF RK Coupe model (which someone ripped from the World of Speed Beta) was based on the Shift/Shift 2 Cayman model, and parts lined up perfectly.
        And the Shift model was based on the Most Wanted model, so I was able to piece together parts from all these models to create a car that was fully customizable in Need for Speed: Most Wanted.
        Back then, I remember not liking how most mods other people uploaded didn’t feature much customization, so I wanted to change that.</p>
        <p>Everything I do is rooted in my faith in Jesus, who said “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you” (Matthew 6:33).
        He also said “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
        God created each and every one of us with love, purpose, and a good plan for our lives. Each of us humans has fallen short of this and sinned, which separates us from God infinitely.
        But out of love for each and every one of us, God made a way to reconnect us with Him, by taking on human life in Jesus and taking our penalty by dying in our place.
        We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God’s love and plan for our lives.
        I hope you, reading this, can come to experience His love and peace if you haven’t already.
        Highly recommend <a href="https://www.cru.org/us/en/how-to-know-god/would-you-like-to-know-god-personally.html">this article</a> if you’d like to know more!</p>
